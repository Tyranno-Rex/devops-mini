### Microservices Deployment on Kubernetes with Load Testing
    OS: VMware Workstation 17 / Ubuntu 24.04.1 live server
    Language: Python 3.12.6, java 21
    Tools: Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, Apache JMeter, Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack (more can be added)
    
### Project Description
    - Develop a microservices-based application with three services (Service A, Service B, Service C).
    - Deploy the microservices to a Kubernetes cluster.
    - Perform load testing on the API Gateway using Apache JMeter.
    - Monitor the performance of the microservices using Prometheus and Grafana.
    - Implement logging and tracing using the ELK Stack.
    - Automate the deployment process using GitLab CI/CD.

### Project Structure

1. **Service Composition**
   - **API Gateway**: Routes client requests to various microservices.
   - **Service A**: User management (e.g., sign-up, login).
   - **Service B**: Product management (e.g., product registration, retrieval).
   - **Service C**: Order management (e.g., create and view orders).
   - **Database**: Each service can have its own database (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB).

2. **Kubernetes Resources**
   - **Deployment**: Configuration for deploying each service.
   - **Service**: Internal IP setup for communication between services.
   - **Ingress**: Routes external requests to the API Gateway.
   - **Persistent Volume**: Manages data persistence for databases.

3. **Load Testing Tools**
   - **Apache JMeter**: Generates HTTP requests for load testing.

### Step-by-Step Approach

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Ubuntu server on VM and set up a Kubernetes cluster(kubeadm)
   - Helm for package management.

2. **Microservice Development**
   - Develop each service as a Docker container.
   - Use RESTful APIs for communication between services.
   - *if needed, use a message broker (e.g., Kafka) for asynchronous communication.*
   - *if needed, use a web socket for real-time communication.*

3. **Deployment to Kubernetes**
    - Create Kubernetes resources for each service.
    - Use Helm for templating and managing Kubernetes resources.
    - Deploy the services to the Kubernetes cluster.

4. **Load Testing**
    - Use Apache JMeter to generate HTTP requests.
    - Perform load testing on the API Gateway.
    - Analyze the performance of the microservices.

5. **Monitoring and Scaling**
    - Use Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring.
    - Scale the services based on the load testing results.
    - Optimize the performance of the microservices.

6. **CI/CD Pipeline**
    - Use GitLab CI/CD for automating the deployment process.

7. **Logging and Tracing**
    - Use ELK Stack for logging and tracing.
    - Monitor the logs and traces for debugging and performance optimization.
